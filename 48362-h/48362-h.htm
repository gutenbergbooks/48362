<p class="newpage p4">I have been asked to write a foreword to Mr. Muirhead
Bone’s drawings. This I am glad to do, as they illustrate
admirably the daily life of the troops under my command.</p>

<p>The conditions under which we live in France are so
different from those to which people at home are accustomed,
that no pen, however skilful, can explain them without the
aid of the pencil.</p>

<p>The destruction caused by war, the wide areas of devastation,
the vast mechanical agencies essential in war, both for
transport and the offensive, the masses of supplies required,
and the wonderful cheerfulness and indomitable courage of
the soldiers under varying climatic conditions, are worthy
subjects for the artist who aims at recording for all time the
spirit of the age in which he has lived.</p>

<p>It has been said that the portrait and the picture are
invaluable aids to the right reading of history. From this
point of view I welcome, on behalf of the Army that I have
the honour to command, this series of drawings, as a
permanent record in pencil of the duties which our soldiers
have been called upon to perform, and the quality and
manner of its performance.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WESTERN_FRONT" id="THE_WESTERN_FRONT"></a>THE WESTERN FRONT</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> British line in France and Belgium runs through country
of three kinds, and each kind is like a part of England.
Between the Somme and Arras a British soldier often feels
that he has not quite left the place of his training on Salisbury
Plain. The main roads may be different, with their endless rows of
sentinel trees, and the farms are mostly clustered into villages, where
they turn their backs to the streets. More of the land, too, is tilled.
But the ground has the same large and gentle undulation; and these
great rollers are made, as in Wiltshire, of pure chalk coated with only
a little brown clay. There are the same wide prospects, the same lack
of streams and ponds, the same ledges and curious carvings of the soil;
and journeys on foot seem long, as they do on our downs, because so
much of the road before you is visible while you march.</p>

<p>A little north of Arras there begins, almost at a turn of the road, a
black country, where men of the South Lancashires feel at home and
grant that the landscape has some of the points of Wigan. It is the
region of Loos and Vermelles and Bully Grenay, most of it level ground
on which the only eminences are the refuse-heaps of coal mines. Across
this level the eye feels its way from one well-known stack of pit-head
buildings and winding machinery to another. They are, to an English
eye, strangely lofty and stand out like lighthouses over a sea. The
villages near their feet are commonly “model” or “garden,” with all
the houses built well, as parts of one plan. As in Lancashire, farming
and mining go on side by side, and in August the corn is grey with a
mixture of blown dusts from collieries and from the road.</p>

<p>The next change is not abrupt, like the first; but it is as great.
Near Ypres you are on the sands, though yet twenty miles from the sea.
Here you have a sense of being in a place still alive but pensioned off
by nature after its work was done. You feel it at Rye and Winchelsea,
at Ravenna, and at any place which the sea has once made great and
then abandoned. The wide Ypres landscape drawn by Mr. Bone was
all mellow on sunny days at the end of July with the warm brown and
yellow of many good crops. Almost up to the British front it was
farmed minutely and intensely; in spring I had seen a man ploughing a
field where a German shell, on the average, dropped every day. But all
this countryside has the brooding quietude of a sort of honourable old
age, dignity and pensiveness and comfort behind its natural rampart of
sand dunes, but not the stir of life at full pressure.</p>

<p>Into this vari-coloured belt of landscape, some ninety miles long,
and into its cities and villages, the war has brought strange violences of
effort and several different degrees of desolation. Some villages are dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
and buried, like Pozières, where you must dig to find where a house
stood. There are cities dead, but with their bones still above ground:
Ypres is one&mdash;many walls stand where they did, but grass is growing
among the broken stones and bits of stained glass on the floor of the
Cloth Hall, and at noon a visitor’s footsteps ring and echo in the empty
streets like those of a belated wayfarer in midnight Oxford. “How doth
the city sit desolate that once was full of people!” Again, there are
towns like Arras, whose flesh, though torn, has life in it still, and seems
to feel a new wound from each shell, though there be no man there to
be hit. These are the broader differences between one part of the front
and another. In any one place there are minor caprices of destruction
or survival. Mr. Bone has drawn the top of the Albert Church tower,
a building that was ugly when it was whole, but now is famous for its
impending figure of the Virgin, knocked by artillery fire into a singular
diving attitude, with the Child in her outstretched hands. Of the two
or three buildings unharmed in Arras one is the oldest house in the
town and another was Robespierre’s birthplace.</p>

<p>In the fields, as you near the front line, you note an ascending scale
of desolation. It is most clear on the battlefield of the Somme. First
you pass across two or three miles of land on which so many shells fall,
or used to fall, that it has not been tilled for two years. It is a waste,
but a green waste, where not trodden brown by horses and men. It is
gay in summer with poppies, convolvolus and cornflowers. Among the
thistles and coarse grass you see self-sown shoots of the old crops, of
beet, mustard and corn. Beyond this zone of land merely thrown idle
you reach the ultimate desert where nothing but men and rats can live.
Here even the weeds have been rooted up and buried by shells, the
houses are ground down to brick-dust and lime and mixed with the earth,
which is constantly turned up and turned up again by more shells and
kept loose and soft. The trees, broken half-way up their trunks and
stripped of leaves and branches, look curiously haggard and sinister.</p>

<p>It is hoped that Mr. Bone’s drawings will give a new insight into
the spirit in which the battle of freedom is being fought. An artist does
not merely draw ruined churches and houses, guards and lorries, doctors
and wounded men. It is for him to make us see something more than
we do even when we see all these with our own eyes&mdash;to make visible
by his art the staunchness and patience, the faithful absorption in the
next duty, the humour and human decency and good nature&mdash;all the
strains of character and emotion that go to make up the temper of
Britain at war.</p>

<p>The gaunt emptiness of Ypres is expressed in this
drawing, done from the doorway of a ruined church in a
neighbouring square. The grass has grown long this
summer on the Grand’Place and is creeping up over the
heaps of ruins. The only continuous sound in Ypres is
that of birds, which sing in it as if it were country.</p>

<span class="subhead">A STREET IN YPRES</span></h3>

<p>In the distance is seen what remains of the Cloth Hall.
On the right a wall long left unsupported is bending to its
fall. The crash of such a fall is one of the few sounds
that now break the silence of Ypres, where the visitor
starts at the noise of a distant footfall in the grass-grown
streets.</p>

<p>The Ypres salient is here seen from a knoll some six
miles south-west of the city, which is marked, near the
centre of the drawing, by the dominant ruin of the
cathedral. The German front line is on the heights
beyond, Hooge being a little to the spectator’s right
of the city and Zillebeke slightly more to the right again.
Dickebusch lies about half way between the eye and
Ypres. The fields in sight are covered with crops, varied
by good woodland. To a visitor coming from the Somme
battlefield the landscape looks rich and almost peaceful.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME</span></h3>

<p>An exciting moment in the fighting for the summit ridge
of the battlefield in August, 1916. All the British guns
have just burst into action and our infantry are advancing
unseen in the cloud of smoke on the sky-line. The puffs
of smoke high in the air are from bursting shrapnel. The
battle is seen from King George’s Hill, near the old
German front line, taken on July 1st, 1916. Below,
among the ravaged trees, are the ruins of Mametz;
beyond them, Mametz Wood; beyond it, again, the wood
of Bazentin-le-Petit.</p>

<p>The drawing shows a former German front-line trench
reduced by our artillery fire, before an advance, to a mass
of capricious looking irregularities in the ground. The
German barbed wire entanglements are seen destroyed by
our shell fire to open the way for our attacking troops.</p>

<p>The hour is Retreat and a Sergeant-Major is inspecting
the three men for duty at a one-man post during the
coming night. Each man in turn will do two hours’ duty,
followed by four hours’ rest. The fine austere drawing
of the sunset, the wide waste spaces, the intent men
mounting picket and the men off duty strolling at ease, is
imbued with the spirit of the region just behind our front.</p>

<span class="subhead">DUG-OUTS</span></h3>

<p>A small hamlet of sand-bagged dug-outs a little behind the
front line, seen during a passing lift of the clouds at the
end of a wet day. Many dug-outs, like the one on the
left, bear such names as “The Rat Hole,” “It,” “Some
Dug-out, believe ma,” “The Old Curiosity Shop” and
“The Ritz.” On the right, a shelf in the outer wall of
sand-bags is decorated with flowers in pots.</p>

<span class="subhead">GORDON HIGHLANDERS: OFFICERS’ MESS</span></h3>

<p>In the bare dancing hall of a village inn behind the
Somme Front. The artist has found means to interpret
with the utmost sympathy and power the extraordinary
romantic quality that there often is about a Highland mess
in France, created by the rude setting, the primitive half
light amidst cavernous gloom, and the spectator’s sense of
an enveloping world of strange dangers and adventures.</p>

<span class="subhead">WAITING FOR THE WOUNDED</span></h3>

<p>A British advance has just begun, and the surgeons of a
Divisional Collecting Station near the Somme are awaiting
the arrival of the first laden stretcher-bearers. In a few
minutes the three officers will be at work, perhaps for
twenty-four hours on end. At one Casualty Clearing
Station a distinguished surgeon performed, without resting,
nineteen difficult operations, each lasting more than an
hour, in cases of severe abdominal wounds, where delay
would have meant the loss of life. In almost every case
the man was saved. Another surgeon operated for thirty-six
hours without relief. Such devotion is not exceptional
in the R.A.M.C.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE HAPPY WARRIOR</span></h3>

<p>The place is a field dressing station. The wounded
Grenadier Guardsman in the foreground on the left,
wearing a German helmet and eating bread and jam, had
brought in as prisoner the German who is sitting on
the right with his hand to his face. The Guardsman
indicated the German to the artist, and said, “Won’t you
draw my pal here, too, Sir? He and me had a turn-up
this morning when we took their trench, and he jabbed
me in the arm and I jabbed him in the eye, and we’re the
best of friends.” Other Germans are sitting in attitudes
characteristic of newly-made prisoners.</p>

<p>Many wounded or sick soldiers, British and French, are
brought by river or canal from near the front to near a
base hospital or the sea. The motion is easy, the men
have good air and quiet; any who are well enough to be
on deck have pleasant and changeful surroundings to look
at. The English have fitted up for this purpose many of
the large, square-built and bluff-bowed&mdash;almost box-like&mdash;French
canal boats. They are towed, in pairs, by small
tugs. The French Red Cross uses barges driven by
engines placed aft.</p>

The quality of the food, and the manner of the gift, give
extraordinary pleasure to the tired men.</p>

<p>The boat here is an old one; in newer boats the accommodation
is finer, but the drawing shows the ordinary
mode of bedding the patients in double tiers of continuous
bunks. At some point in the passage an R.A.M.C.

<h2 class="nobreak chap">THE SOMME BATTLEFIELD.</h2>

<div class="intro">
<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> main Anglo-German battlefield of 1916 is a little range of
chalk down or blunt hill. It is ten miles long and seven miles
wide, and its watershed runs from north-west to south-east&mdash;from
near Thiepval, above the small river Ancre, to Combles,
four miles to the north of the canalised Somme. This summit ridge is
not quite 500 feet high&mdash;about as high as the Hog’s Back in Surrey.
The south-western slope of the range is rather steeper and more broken
up into terraces and lateral ridges and defiles than the north-eastern
slope. There is no real escarpment, but enough difference to make the
south-western slope the harder to attack.</p>

<p>Small as this ridge is, it is the highest ground, in these parts,
between the Belgian plain and the main plain of Northern France. It is
crossed at right angles by one great road, the famous French Route
Nationale that runs nearly dead straight from Rouen, through Amiens,
to Valenciennes, and so leads on to Brussels by Mons. On the battlefield,
between Albert and Bapaume, it reaches the highest point above the sea
in all its long course, at a spot where a heap of powdered brick and
masonry, forty yards off to the north, marks the site of the Windmill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Pozières, one of those solitary buildings to which, like Falfemont Farm
and the Abbey at Eaucourt, the war has brought death and immortality.</p>

<p>From this road, at one point or another, you can see most of the
places that were made famous in 1916. A mile and a half from Albert,
as you go out north-eastward, you spy in a hollow below you a whitish
sprinkling of mixed mud, brick-dust and lime, the remains of La
Boisselle, on the right of the road. On its left a second grey patch is
the site of Ovillers. Beyond La Boisselle Contalmaison is just out of sight
behind a shoulder of hill. Nearly all the most hard-fought woods are in
sight&mdash;High Wood on the sky-line, and Delville Wood larger on its
right, and then in succession, with sharp intervals of bareness between
them, the woods of Bazentin, Mametz and Fricourt. Above them and
more distant are the dense trees that have Maricourt and the French
troops at their feet, and, high on their right, the thin file of trees shading
the road that runs from Albert, past Carnoy and Cléry, to Peronne.
You walk on for three miles and may not observe that you have passed
through Pozières, so similar are raw chalk and builder’s lime, raw clay
and powdered brick, when weeds grow thick over both. But the great
road&mdash;strangely declined into a rough field track&mdash;begins to fall away
before you, and new prospects to open&mdash;Courcelette and Martinpuich
almost at your feet, and straight beyond them the church and town hall
of Bapaume at the end of the long avenue of roadside trees. Looking
left you see, two miles away, the western end of the summit ridge, the
last point upon it from which the Germans were driven; so that, even
after the fall of Thiepval, a shell would sometimes come from the
Schwaben Redoubt to remind unwary walkers at Pozières Windmill that
enemy eyes still watched the lost ground.</p>

<p>Among the wreckage of the countryside you can detect the traces of
old standing comfort and rustic wealth. The many wayside windmills
show you how much corn was grown. In size and plan they are
curiously like the mighty stone dovecotes of Fifeshire. Almost as
frequent as ruined windmills are ruined sugar refineries, standing a
little detached in the fields, like the one at Courcelette, for which armies
fought as they fought for the neighbouring windmill. Beet was the next
crop to grain. There were little industries, too, like the making of
buttons for shirts at Fricourt, where you see by the road small refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
heaps of old oyster shells with many round holes where the little discs
have been cut cleanly out of the mother-of-pearl, though all other trace
of the factories has vanished. Each village commune had its wood, with
certain rights for the members of the commune to take timber; Fricourt
Wood at the doors of Fricourt, Mametz Wood rather far from Mametz,
as there was no good wood nearer. All these woods were well fenced
and kept up, like patches of hedged cover dotted over a park. It was a
good country to live in, and good men came from it. The French Army
Corps that drew on these villages for recruits has won honour beyond all
other French Corps in the battle of the Somme.</p>

<p>Many skilled writers have tried to describe the aghast look of these
fields where the battle had passed over them. But every new visitor
says the same thing&mdash;that they had not succeeded; no eloquence has yet
conveyed the disquieting strangeness of the portent. You can enumerate
many ugly and queer freaks of the destroying powers&mdash;the villages not
only planed off the face of the earth but rooted out of it, house by house,
like bits of old teeth; the thin brakes of black stumps that used to be
woods, the old graveyards wrecked like kicked ant-heaps, the tilth so
disembowelled by shells that most of the good upper mould created by
centuries of the work of worms and men is buried out of sight and the
unwrought primeval subsoil lies on the top; the sowing of the whole
ground with a new kind of dragon’s teeth&mdash;unexploded shells that the
plough may yet detonate, and bombs that may let themselves off if their
safety pins rust away sooner than the springs within. But no piling up of
sinister detail can express the sombre and malign quality of the battlefield
landscape as a whole. “It makes a goblin of the sun”&mdash;or it might if it
were not peopled in every part with beings so reassuringly and engagingly
human, sane and reconstructive as British soldiers.</p>

proved by the fate of too many of our hospital ships.</p>

exchanged, and perhaps the merits and demerits of the
Ypres salient, or the most advantageous use of “tanks,”
warmly debated, as is the custom of privates of the New
Army. Silent or vocal, a great beatitude fills the vessel.</p>

perhaps, to the more individual character of a

which leads to success in flying. The officers are
drawn from all sorts of regiments, and each continues to

<p>At Arras the Germans always seem very near you. In

do the two front trenches come so close to each other.
The result is a subtle quality of apprehensiveness
in the atmosphere of the silent empty city. It
seems like someone standing on tiptoe, peering and
listening, in a solitary place, for some vague unseen
danger, or like a horse nervously pricking its ears, you
cannot tell why. This tingle of uncanny dread
has been conveyed with remarkable success in this

behind the front line, always watch the arrival of new
prisoners with silent curiosity. Those of our soldiers who
have themselves fought with the Germans, and captured
them, usually befriend them with cigarettes and drinks
from water-bottles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak chap">TRENCH SCENERY.</h2>

<div class="intro">
<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> one of these drawings Mr. Bone gives a rousing glimpse of trench
life at a moment of action. These are its moments of transfiguration,
when all the glow of courage, that has been banked down and
husbanded through months of waiting and guarding, bursts, at a
word of command, into flame. The rest of trench life is work,
contrivance and observation. It has been called monotonous. But, for
any man who has not lost the heart of a boy, it has the relish of an endlessly
changeful outdoor adventure, a game with the earth and the
weather, as well as with the more official enemy.</p>

<p>No two points in an Allied front trench are wholly alike. Certain
general patterns there are, but no facsimiles. Each traverse or bay has
a look of its own; it is personal and expresses, as Robinson Crusoe’s
stockade might have done, the nature of some man or men making shift,
each after his kind, to put up what they could, in the shortest time,
between their bodies and danger. A German firing trench is less various.
In it you seem to see the minds of a few large and able contractors; in
ours the minds of thousands of good campers-out. To put it in another
way, the German trench has, in some measure, the quality of a long street
built, well enough, to a single design; ours possesses the charm of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
strip of coast or a long country lane, where nature or man has made
every indentation and turn a surprise, and each farmer has made gates
and hedges to his own mind.</p>

<p>The line goes through wonderful places and charges them with
singular thrills of romance. It has made windmills famous as forts, and
brought herons into the suburbs of cities. In one place it runs across
water and land so intermixed that the sentries of both armies are upon
little islands crowned with breast-works like grouse butts; you see them,
when the winter evening falls, standing immobile, waist-deep in mist,
each man about forty yards from his enemy. Men have stood there, turn
by turn, for two years and a half, moving softly and whispering as if in a
church, till the shyest of wildfowl have learnt to treat the surrounding marsh
as their own, and the only sound is of wild duck and snipe astir between
the muzzles of two nations’ loaded rifles, snipe safe among the snipers.
At more than one place the two front lines converge until each sentry
knows that he is within a gentle bomb’s throw of the enemy. Out of the
firing trench, at one of these places, you walk on tiptoe along a short sap
that halves this short distance, and from its end you look up at a small
heap of rubble&mdash;a couple of cart-loads&mdash;and know that some German
is cautiously listening, like you, on its further side.</p>

<p>Those are the cramped and contorted parts of the front. A few miles
away it will straighten and loose itself out; you see it run free, in great,
easy curves, up the slopes of wide moorlands, the two front lines drawn
apart almost three hundred yards. Each is a double band of colour; the
white ribbon of its dug chalk and the broader rust-brown ribbon of its
tangled wire stand out clear against the shabby velveteen grey of the
heath. Here there is less of thrill and more of ease in trench life; by day
the sentries peer, hour by hour, into the baffling mist that is woven
across their sight by our own and the enemy’s wire; it is like trying
to see through low and leafless, but thick, undergrowth. By night the
wire makes, to the sentry’s eye, a middle stratum of opaque dark grey,
between the full blackness of the earth below it and the more penetrable
obscurity of the night air above. But the darkness is never trusted for
long. All night each army is sending up rocket-like lights to burst and
hang like arc lamps in the air over the firing trench of the other. From
a commanding point you can see, at any moment of any night, scores
of these ascending rockets, each like a line drawn on the dark with a
pencil of flame, arching over to intersect each other near the zenith of
their flight, incessantly tracing and re-tracing the lines of a Gothic nave
over all No Man’s Land, from the Alps to the sea. All night, too, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
is a kind of pulse of light in the sky, along the whole front, from the
flash of guns. From the trenches the flash itself can seldom be seen, but
the sky winks and winks from moment to moment with the spread and
contraction of a trembling radiance like summer lightning.</p>

<p>At most parts of the line a man in the front trench is cut off from
landscape. To look at a tree behind the enemy’s lines may be to give
a mark to a sniper hidden in its boughs. By day you see the upper half
of the dome of the sky, and, through loopholes, a few yards of rough
earth or chalk, then the nebulous wire and, through its thin places, perhaps
a few uniforms, blue, grey or brown, lying beyond, among the coarse
grass and weeds. At night you see all the stars well, and on moonlight
nights, if you walk the trench softly, you can watch strange friezes sharply
silhouetted on the sky line of the parapet, the wars and loves of capering
rats, “flouting the ivory moon.” Whole choirs of larks may be heard:
neither cannon nor small arms seem to alarm them; and most of the
ground has its own hawk to quarter it daily.</p>

<p>To men put on this short allowance of natural sights and sounds
it is an extraordinary pleasure to find in the rear of their trench a clean
rivulet, such as often occurs in chalk land, where the surface water filters
rapidly in and comes out at the bases of slopes like so many crystal springs.
But the greatest of all trench delights is the re-discovery, every year,
of the sun. Some day in March it is suddenly found to have a miraculous
warmth, and everybody off duty comes out like the bees and stands about
in the trench, sunning his head and shoulders in the tepid rays and
adoring&mdash;quite inarticulately&mdash;and feeling that all’s well with the world.
A winter in trenches revives, in us children of civilisation, a pre-Promethean
rapture of love for the sun; and the dark nights, in which
not a match must be struck, makes us, at any rate, think more highly
than ever we did of the moon, which halves the strain of the soldier on
guard, and of the stars which guide him back overland to his billet, at
a relief, to sleep in Elysium. So, for a man who has all his senses alive
and unjaded, the hard and bare life has its compensations. It makes him
do without many things; but it also quickens delight in the things
which are at the base of all the rest, and without which there could not
have been the incomparable adventure and spectacle of life on the earth.</p>

<span class="subhead">CASSEL</span></h3>

<p>Cassel has no great part in this war. But it has endured
ancient sieges; three notable battles have taken its name
since 1070; the last of them led to the annexation of
Cassel to France in 1678 and gave her a town finely set
on a hill amidst lowlands, and equally good to look at and
look from. The many windmills about it give Cassel an
air of liveliness as you approach, and this cheerful effect
is maintained on reaching the main square, drawn by
Mr. Bone, with its lightsome spaciousness and comfortable,
well-proportioned houses. The eyes of passing Scottish
soldiers find a familiar look in the “step” gables of many
of Cassel’s roofs. One is seen on the right.</p>

as it must look to a threatened enemy, the very embodiment
of momentum irresistibly grinding its way towards its
prey. In the presence of “tanks” as here drawn&mdash;though
there is no trace of exaggeration in the drawing&mdash;the
spectator is as a crushed worm and, in fact, finds there
is more force in that phrase than he knew.</p>

hot meals for the men in the front trenches. From cookhouses
like the one shown in the drawing, or from travelling
field kitchens, the hot stew and tea are brought up the
communication trench in dixies, two to a platoon, each
dixie being slung from a pole carried on two men’s
shoulders. The cooks work under shell fire and many
have been killed.</p>

massive impassivity&mdash;for the present&mdash;of the thing they
have created. “A great gun,” it has been said, “is so
<i>sheer</i>.” In a gun shop it dwarfs everything round it and
seems the embodiment, at the same time, of immobility
and of menace.</p>

<p>A store containing loaded shells of every calibre. All the
plant has been made since 1914, in answer to the challenge
of German militarism. The railway trucks in the foreground
are incessantly filled and refilled from the supplies
pouring into the store for dispatch to the front. Women
drive the cranes that gather up bunches of shells from
any part of the building and lower them, with absolute
precision, to their appointed places in the trucks. All
handling of shells must be cautious and deliberate, but the
work proceeds, without haste and without rest, at a
remarkable speed.</p>

house about thirty men. If the straw be deep and the roof
sound it makes better quarters than anything but a good
bedroom. Its chief drawback in the men’s eyes is that
smoking has to be forbidden because of the straw. In the
winter evenings the men usually cross the farmyard to
the kitchen, where they smoke and make friends with the
farmer, and buy coffee, at a penny a bowl, from his wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak chap">THE UPPER HAND</h2>

<div class="intro">
<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> these better days it is no harm to speak of the time when the
Marne had been won and yet our Army in France was within an
inch of its life. The thread of its fate had frayed very thin; only
one strand remained; at last, not even that&mdash;what had taken its
place was a gallant sham, a last forlorn bluff, scarcely a hope. And then
came the ancient reward of those who fight on without hope. Like
a storm that had blown itself out, the strain was suddenly gone. The
strong had not known all their strength, the weak had steadfastly hidden
their weakness, and they had worn out the strong.</p>

<p>That extreme peril has never recurred. But there were months in
1915 when men in our trenches still felt that the upper hand was not
theirs. What would happen was this. Once or twice in the day the
Germans, after their meals, would spray a piece of our trench with
trench-mortar bombs and rifle-grenades. As a rule they did not mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
to attack, in the fuller sense. The piece was not an overture; it was
complete in itself; a sort of isolated <i>pas d’intimidation</i>. Not many men
on our side would be killed. But, while the shower went on, everyone
on duty in our firing trench felt with crystal clearness that he was on the
defensive. At each fresh discharge he would plaster himself upon the
front wall of the trench and gaze upwards for the coming evil. If he
saw the approaching waddle of a trench-mortar bomb, wagging its tail
through the air, he would judge it like a catch in the long field, only with
an ardent desire to miss it; and to this end he would jump round corners
of trench and put solid angles of earth between him and the large muted
sound like “pfloonk” that was to ensue. If what he heard was the thin
hiss or spit of a rifle grenade, then he knew that it could not be seen,
and he kept his head down and wondered how near the venomous little
metallic smash of the burst would be. In any case he was bespattered,
throughout the bombardment, with little falling bits of earth, warm
metals and products of combustion; the tinkling of this hail on his helmet
deepened his rueful sense of resemblance to a hen crouching under the
lee of a hedge in bad weather. And, all this time, our own mortars and
guns would be silent or&mdash;almost worse than silence itself&mdash;would reply
with the mildness of Sterne’s patient ass. “Please do not shell our front
trench. But, if you want to, you may,” so they seemed to be saying.</p>

<p>From these mortifications the men in the firing trench, and the
gunners who had endured the sharper torment of not being able to help
them, were saved by the women, whom Mr. Bone shows us working at
home, arming their knights for battle in a sense more valid than any
known to Froissart or Malory. There came a time, most moving and
memorable to all who were then in our trenches, when any German
attempt to gall them began to evoke new, heart-warming sounds. All
the upper air, over the place where the pelted sentries were crouching,
seemed to have come to life on our side. At last our own trench mortars
were answering, not in a few grudged monosyllables, but volubly, out of
the fulness of the dump. Higher up also, there rose arch over arch, as
it were, of audible, reassuring protection&mdash;first the low-pitched bridges of
sound traced by the whizz of our field guns, and then the vast rainbow
curve of our heavier shells making wing, high over head, with a more
august, leisurely waft that sounded divinely. It was a changed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
cheered world to be living in. We had the upper hand now, and every
woman turning a shell or driving a crane in England had helped us to
have it.</p>

<p>We have it now still more securely. Since that time we have learnt
the technique of attack&mdash;how to keep what we take and how to take
what we want at no more than it need cost in lives. We have won, in
hard fight, the best of all posts of observation&mdash;the sky, so that during
the great engagements last year on the Somme there was not a German
aeroplane to be seen in the air while ours were ranging everywhere over
the battlefield, each with its eyes on the enemy’s lines and its voice at the
ear of our guns. Our men and the gunners have now crossed bayonets
so often that all the old awe in which Europe held the men of Sedan and
Sadowa is gone; boys from Wiltshire and Worcestershire farms, recruits
of a few months before, have chased Prussian guardsmen uphill out of
their trenches and then held these ruined defences against all that those
picked products of intensive military culture could do to regain them.</p>

<p>All this turning of tables has been brought about by one cause, in
the sense that if that cause had been absent, the care and skill of the
finest leaders, the daring of all our airmen, the staunchness of all our
infantry would have been strength to no purpose. Munition workers
have woven the curtain of smoke that our gunners now draw between our
advancing troops and the eyes of their enemy. It is munitions that,
thrown from our howitzers, make level roads through the tangles of wire
on which, in the old days, the corpses of whole platoons of our men were
hung up to rot and look, from far off, like washing put out to dry on
thorned hedges. It is munitions that, when we attack, hold back the
hostile supports behind a wall of falling bullets as hard to pass as Adam
found the flaming sword at the gate. It is, then, not without reason that
in this sheaf of drawings of the war on the Western front are included
some drawings of guns and shells in the making. They are drawings of
victory in the making, and of the saving of hundreds of thousands of
British lives.</p>

the brilliant pigmy engines shining like jewels&mdash;all seem
gay and exhilarating after the sombre company of the guns.
There is even a lightsome airiness about the thought that

<p>Landscape near Arras is like the biblical vine hanging over
a wall&mdash;“All the archers have shot at her.” Injured, but
not yet destroyed, the woods seem like creatures scared, as
if the trees themselves were possessed with the disquiet of
dryads crouching somewhere in hiding. Many different
parts of the front have their own almost personal expression,
but it is seldom one of fear. At and around Arras this
expression of alarm is so curiously strong that, if he
transgressed prose, the visitor might fancy the taut
bulrushes were nature’s hair standing on end, and a slight
stir in the poplars her shudder. By some means, which a
layman cannot mark down, Mr. Bone has suffused his
drawing with his own sense of the tragic queerness of this
vacuous and unnerved landscape.</p>

<p>Whether on the road between a rail-head and the front, or
during a halt by the way, or at rest in their own park, the
lorries of a Division keep their proper distance or interval
from each other, like men on parade. If one falls lame it
is taken in tow; if disabled past towing, it falls out and
waits for a first-aid mobile workshop to come and repair it.
The scene here is one of the two chief roads to the Somme
front. In July and August, 1916, the procession of lorries
along it was often unbroken for several miles. Field
railways have much lightened its traffic since then.</p>

<p>To most English soldiers it is one of the compensations,

have to do work which is not their own trade nor a regular
part of all soldiering. They find a flavour of the sport of
peace-time camping-out in the work of making or finding
their own shelter from the weather. Sometimes it is done,
as here, with excellent materials, sometimes with hardly
any at all, and the man who has built himself a rain-proof
hut, for one, out of a few old biscuit tins, some sticks and
a waste piece of corrugated iron enjoys a special thrill of
triumphant ingenuity.</p>

both ways through Maricourt and raising a barrage of dust

there was a doubled post of military police, one man
British and one French, ready with rebuke or instruction
in either tongue. The place is now several miles behind

seniors, the covered vans of French country carriers and,
still older, the long, low, French farm wagons now drawn
by horses, but built, as is shown by the very low pole, for
draught oxen. In the market place there wait also the cars
of British staff officers visiting the town. The handsome

trail behind the transport wagons and field kitchens, taking
a tow with one hand. Odds and ends of light baggage are
carried in little, almost toy-like hand-carts, the men pulling
them by many ropes and pushing them from behind.
Some men, perhaps, are wearing German helmets. Everyone’s
face has a look of contented collapse, the restful
reaction of senses and nerves relaxed after many days of
strained attention and short sleep. The weary and happy

<div class="intro">
<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Our</span> Western front is a line that does not really end at the sea.
If it did, then its left flank might be turned. But its real left
flank is not there. It is somewhere far out on a line that
runs north-west of Nieuport, through and beyond the North
Sea. The British soldier in Belgium or France may not see much of the
Navy itself. But every day brings him some proof that the Navy is
holding its part of the line. His letters never go wrong, and he knows
that, but for the Fleet, they would have to make their way to him like
swimmers across a bay full of sharks. It is faith in the Navy that makes
the men going on leave laugh when obeying the order to put on lifebelts
on leaving harbour. In the soldier’s mind that long left flank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
our line is not forgotten but rather written off, once for all, as unbreakable.
He puts much the same sort of trust in the power of the Fleet as
he puts in the affection of friends at home. To him it is one of the
things that need never be feared for; it cannot fail.</p>

<p>This is not to say that soldiers underrate the hardness of the Navy’s
task. A few sailors visit the front from time to time and hold curious
arguments with the soldiers, each side being deeply convinced that the
other has the harder time of it. The soldier’s imagination is struck by
the large proportion of deaths among the casualties of naval war and by
visions of night duty on vessels at sea in bad winter weather. What
strikes the sailor, in presence of the imperfections of dug-outs, is the
soldier’s hardship of not being able to “go below” into some small
cubic space of warmth and dryness when action is over or a watch is
through. When a naval officer, who visited the Somme front last
summer, and saw a fight near Martinpuich, rejoined the ship that he
commanded, he paraded his whole ship’s company and spent two hours
in telling them what a rough time the soldiers had, and what fine work
they were doing. The generosity of the praise made his soldier guide
feel almost ashamed, remembering the almost instant fate of the “Cressy,”
“Aboukir,” and “Hogue,” and the obedience of the “Theseus” to the
heart-breaking order to abandon her sinking consort.</p>

<p>Few officers or men from the western front can visit the Fleet; but
the winds of chance, which blow casualties and convalescents all about
Great Britain, drop a few of them down in spots where the Fleet, as
Mr. Bone draws it, is under their eyes. Drawings like those of “A Fleet
Seascape” (LXXXIX) and “A Line of Destroyers” (LXXXVI) awake
recollections of guard duty in a small Scotch fishing village; of the
majestic seaward procession through the midsummer night, before the
battle of Jutland; of the return from the fight, the destroyers streaming
tranquilly back to their moorings under the hill, with the great searchlight
wheeling to and fro along the sea outside them, like a sentry moving
alertly on his post; a few wounded ships steaming in more sedately, or
taking a tow, one with a couple of funnels knocked out of the straight,
another with a field-dressing of bedding stuffed into a hole in her side,
and the whole wound, apparently, smeared with red paint, as the
surgeons smear flesh wounds with yellow; and then of the coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
ashore, the men triumphant and happy, the officers learning with
astonishment and indignation that people at home had heard more of
losses than of the victory.</p>

<p>Mr. Bone’s drawings give an insight into the world of the Navy to
which these random glimpses can add nothing. “H.M.S. ‘Lion’ in dry
dock” (LXXXIII) is wonderful, technically&mdash;if a layman may judge&mdash;and
in spirit. A whole aspect of modern naval life is lit up by
“A boiler-room on a battleship” (XCIII). For, to the astonished
landsman visiting a man-of-war, the sailors of to-day seem to work and
eat and sleep in a variety of engineering laboratories, surrounded by
countless wheels, handles, buttons and bells for the evocation or
dismissal of the genies of steam, petrol and electricity. Nothing could
be more unlike the lower decks of seventeenth and eighteenth century
battleships as we imagine them. The only things which have not
changed, from the days of Drake to those of Hawke, and from Nelson’s
time to Beatty’s, are the hereditary instinct for the sea and the fine
fighting temperament of officers and men.</p>

the coaling of a great ship in the old way. The scene
shown in the drawing was animated by the changeful gleam
of the gay signal flags flapping in the foreground and by
the flashing of the wings of innumerable hungry gulls.</p>
